          <p>Negativity, like positivity, can be beneficial when not in excess.</p>

          <p>Negative feelings are natural. They let people know when they are in a bad situation and when they are not feeling safe. These feelings can motivate people to do something to make the situation better until they feel better. Sometimes, just having a bad feeling about something can be the push to dig a little deeper into a situation. While there can be several reasons why one feels a certain feeling, there is not always a need to look for a reason immediately. <b>Negative feelings are valid and suppressing them can create stress, depression, anxiety, or even result in physical illness.</b> </p>

          <p>Negative thinking is one of the tools people have in order to survive. People have a tendency to focus on negative aspects in order to increase survival and this is called “Negativity Bias”. By paying attention to the negatives, people are more careful and more resilient in the face of problems. By knowing that things can go awry, people are able to prepare and prevent the worst possible outcome. They can bounce back rather than get bogged down by unexpected problems, which is bound to happen. Being able to grow after facing difficult situations is one of the benefits of negative thinking.</p>

            <p>Another benefit of negative thinking is that it grounds people. With negative thinking comes a more realistic point of view regarding matters of the self and regarding others because it gives space to think critically. Thinking negatively can lead people to question the motivations and intentions of authority figures. It informs us that perhaps it isn’t the best course of action to leave the house door wide open. It helps us notice actions like microaggressions for what they are. By seeing these negative situations, people can work towards changing the situation. <b>Only by acknowledging that something is wrong can anything be changed.</b> </p>

          <p>Ultimately negative thinking gives value to positive thinking. Without one or the either, there is no reference point for what we deem as negative and positive. Acknowledging the necessity of negative and positive thinking helps create a healthy balance between the two, where people can reap the benefits of both. </p>
